### Figure 1:

Figure 1 is a chloropeth map that visualizes the distribution of general noise complaints in Manhattan. It shows a trend in increase of noise complaints near downtown and uptown Manhattan. 

### Figure 2:

![figure2](https://github.com/Jaypwee/NYU_UDM/blob/master/UDM_Assignment2/NoiseDistributionMap.png)

Figure 2 is a point distribution map with 4 types of complaints: 

- Loud music or party 
- Ice cream truck
- Construction
- Animals

Excluding the other types of complaints, the map shows a high amount of complaints from loud music and party, especially in uptown and downtown. Such may be one reason that might support why downtown and uptown areas had more complaints.

### Figure 3:

Figure 3 shows the median age distribution in Manhattan. Right away, we can see a similarity between Figure 2 and Figure 3, seeing how areas with high music/party noise complaints are located where median age is lower than other areas. Also, since universities in Manhattan are mostly located in either the downtown or uptown, it becomes clear that noise complaints from loud music and party can be generally due to university students that are located nearby.
